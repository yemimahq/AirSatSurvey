# AirSat Survey Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents an analysis of the **AirSat dataset**, which contains survey results from passengers of a commercial airline.  

The dataset was originally provided in **CSV format** and later converted into **Excel** for easier handling.  
The analysis itself was performed using **JMP (a SAS analytics program)**. Since JMP is licensed software, I captured my process as **screenshots** and compiled them into a Word document. This ensures anyone can review the analysis steps, outputs, and findings without needing JMP installed.
